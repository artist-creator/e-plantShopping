# e-plantShopping

e-plantShopping is a React-based shopping application developed as part of the IBM Front-End Developer Professional Certificate final project.

This application represents an online plant nursery called **Paradise Nursery**, where users can browse a variety of houseplants, add them to a shopping cart, and manage cart items dynamically. The project demonstrates the use of React components, state management with Redux, and navigation between multiple pages.

The application includes:
- A landing page with company information and a Get Started button
- A product listing page with categorized plants and Add to Cart functionality
- A shopping cart page to view, update, and remove selected plants
